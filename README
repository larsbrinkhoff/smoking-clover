The code for drawing the clover itself is taken from the X11 port by
Kenneth Stailey (around 1989).

My main changes:

* color cube walk, as suggested by Ed Swalenberg in a message to
ITS-Lovers April 4, 2002.

* GTK port

* remove requirement to run on a psuedo color visual

Currently, it compiles and runs nicely on a RedHat 7.2 pentium system
with at 16 bit display.  I've done a little bit on support for pseudo
color, but that doesn't work yet.

This is still a work in progress.  See the file BUGS for the main open
issues.
